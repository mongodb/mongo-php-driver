# The following tasks are used to build with different libmongoc versions.
# If libmongoc is not set to a stable version, disable the first two builds and only leave the last one enabled.
# When updating libmongoc to a stable release, make sure all builds are enabled.
# These tasks are used in the build task group "build-php-libmongoc" defined in .evergreen/config/build-task-groups.yml,
# where the "max_hosts" setting must be set to the number of enabled tasks.
# Last but not least, make sure the corresponding test variants are enabled in .evergreen/config/test-variants.yml
